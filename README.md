NLWeer is a simple open-source and privacy-friendly Dutch weather app for Android (5.0 or newer). It is free both as in free lunch and as in freedom. The code is MIT licensed. Weather information is provided by KNMI or optionally by Buienradar, see the about screen in the app for more information.

This is what it looks like:
